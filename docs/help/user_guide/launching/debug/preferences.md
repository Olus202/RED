Following settings found at `[ Window -> Preferences -> Robot Framework ->
Launching ->

preference page which can be adjusted in order to influence debugger behavior:

  * **Omit library keywords when stepping into/return** \- disables possibility to enter into the library keyword - see [Assistance editor](hitting_a_breakpoint.html#assist_editor) paragraph for more information, 

  * **Suspend execution whenever debugger goes into erroneous state** \- as described in [ Debugger Basics](../debug.md) topic the debugger can suspend when going into erroneous state. With this preference the behavior can be enabled or disabled (by default user is asked each time what to do).
