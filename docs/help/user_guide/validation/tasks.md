## Detecting tasks/TODO defined in comments

It is a common practice to put notes in comments describing some kind of tasks
which needs to be done in future. RED offers possibility to detect such tasks
and overview them in single place.

Tasks detection is done during validation phase, so the validation itself has
to be enabled too. Once everything is enabled RED will start reporting special
kinds of markers similarly as Problems, but of different type (Task). For
example in following code there are two tasks defined in comments:

# TODO implement more test scenarios  
*** Test Cases ***  
case  
    Should Be Equal    1    2    # FIXME this assertion does not pass  
    ...

The detection is based on tags. When defined tag is found by RED inside the
comment it will be reported as a **task**. By default there are two tags which
RED recognizes: **TODO** and **FIXME** : the first one has normal priority
while the latter is reported with high priority. The tags and their priorities
can be specified in preferences.

Detected tasks are visible in RED in couple of places:

  * **Tasks** view - this view is similar to Problems view and displays all the tasks reported for files in whole workspace (this view can be open from menu by choosing **`Window -> Show View -> Other... -> General -> Tasks`** ), 
  * **Source** tab of editor - icon is visible in line where task is defined on left vertical ruler as well as small square on right overview vertical ruler, 
  * **Tables** tab of editor - icon is visible on element to which the task is attached on left ruler, 
  * **syntax coloring** of comment - the detected tag is colored differently than the rest of the comment both in source tab as well as tables 

### Preferences

Following preferences can be changed regarding tasks detection:

  * **detection enablement** \- whole mechanism can be enabled or disabled at _[Task Tags](javascript:executeCommand\('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences\(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.tasks\)'\))_ page, 
  * **tags and their priorities** \- different tags can be specified at same _[Task Tags](javascript:executeCommand\('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences\(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.tasks\)'\))_ page, 
  * **tags syntax coloring** \- the color of syntax highlighting for task tags can be specified at _[Syntax Coloring](javascript:executeCommand\('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences\(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.editor.syntax\)'\))_ page, 
  * **marker annotations** color and appearance used by editor can be changed at _[Annotations](javascript:executeCommand\('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences\(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.editors.preferencePages.Annotations\)'\))_ page.
