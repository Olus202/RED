## Limiting validation scope

When working with bigger projects, it is good to limit validation scope to
project parts relevant to current work to speed up validation and reduce test
error markers to be relevant to files under scope.

Excluded project parts are still parsed so code completion is preserved, just
validation is omitted thus validation errors and warnings are skipped for
excluded folders.

Note

    Excluded project parts will be skipped also in other features connected to validation like Library Autodiscovering and Robot Framework Lint analysis. 

Include/exclude can be triggered in Project Explorer under right click menu on
selected folders:

Include/exclude can also be found in red.xml editor under Validation table -
include/exclude action is available as right click menu.

Note

    All hidden project parts (files and folders with names starting with ".") are automatically excluded from validation. 

In case of big amounts of .txt or .tsv files which are not Robot test cases,
validation can be excluded on files bigger than size threshold.

Note

    File size limit is not taken into account during validation of files currently edited within Suite Editor.

Note that exclude folders are grayed out, exclude state is inherited from
parent folders.
